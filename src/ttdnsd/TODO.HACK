Important tasks for next minor release:

    Finish audit of ttdnsd.c

Nice things that would be useful but are not critical:

    Add service like funcionality for Ubuntu and other flavors of Gnu/Linux
    Ask helix to package for deb.torproject.org.
    autoconf the entire build process for better portability
