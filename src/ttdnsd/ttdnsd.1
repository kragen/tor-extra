.SH NAME
ttdnsd - The Tor TCP DNS Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
ttdnsd [-h | [-b
.I 127.0.0.1
-p
.I 53
-f
.I /etc/ttdns.conf
-P
.I /var/run/ttdnsd/pid
-C
.I /var/run/ttdnsd/
-c -d -l]
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B ttdnsd(1)
is a small UDP to TCP DNS shim for use with the
.B tor(1)
SOCKS proxy interface. It should also work with other SOCKS proxies.

.B ttdnsd(1)
requires a single recursive DNS listener on the open
internet to be useful. It provides no DNS caching support and may be chained
with
.B unbound(1)
or another DNS caching program for performance reasons. By default
.B ttdnsd(1)
ships with
.I 8.8.8.8
as the open TCP DNS resolver.

.B ttdnsd(1)
creates a TCP connection through the configured SOCKS proxy to the randomly
chosen DNS resolver(s) as configured in
.I /etc/ttdns.conf
; the connection is held open for a reasonable amount of time and subsequently
closed when it is no longer in use. This allows users to make arbitrary DNS
queries to will exit from the Tor network to the configured resolver(s).

.SH OPTIONS

.B -h
.IP
Print usage information for
.B ttdnsd(1)
.P

.B -b
.IP
Address to bind to - usually this should be 127.0.0.1
.P

.B -p
.IP
Port to listen on - almost always this should be port 53
.P

.B -f
.IP
Configuration file for ttdnsd - pre-chroot
.P

.B -P
.IP
Full path to the desired location of the pid file - pre-chroot
.P

.B -C
.IP
Full path to alternate
.B chroot(2)
directory - obviously, pre-chroot
.P

.B -c
.IP
Do not chroot
.B ttdnsd(1)
when running - useful for debugging
.P

.B -d
.IP
Debugging mode
.P

.B -l
.IP
Logging mode - this logs into ttdnsd.log
.P

.SH FILES
.B /etc/ttdns.conf
.IP
Must contain at least a single IP address for a TCP aware DNS resolver
.P

.B /var/run/ttdnsd/pid
.IP
The default pid file
.P

.B /var/run/ttdnsd/
.IP
The default ttdnsd chroot path
.P

.B /var/run/ttdnsd/tsocks.conf
.IP
contains the proper
.B tsocks(1)
configuration 
.P

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B TSOCKS_CONF_FILE
.IP 
.B TSOCKS_CONF_FILE 
should point to a
.I tsocks.conf
configuration file within the configured
.B chroot(2)
.

By default the
.B tsocks
configuration file is placed inside the chroot.
By default this is named 
.I tsocks.conf
and it is configured to use the standard Tor SOCKS IP address and port
combination. This only needs to be set if you're mucking about.
.P

.SH EXAMPLE USAGE
Running as root will automatically switch to user 
.I nobody
and group 
.I nogroup
by running the following command:

.B TSOCKS_CONF_FILE=tsocks.conf ttdnsd -b 127.0.0.1 -p 53 -P /var/run/ttdnsd/pid

If you're running Gnu/Linux you may use the included init.d script: 

.B /etc/init.d/ttdnsd start

.SH EXIT STATUS

These are currently undocumented. Obviously we're shooting for
.I ttdnsd
to run forever and it should exit with 
.I 0
when you've properly shut it down.

.SH PRIVACY

There may be 
.B unintended privacy or security issues
from DNS tampering or tracking from your configured open recursive DNS
resolver. Consider yourself warned!

.SH BUGS
It's likely! Let us know by contacting tor-assistants@torproject.org

Note that
.B ttdnsd(1)
is still in Alpha, and may not work as expected.
