Howto use libttdnstor

/etc/resolv.conf.tor contains your real nameserver(s) e.g. the ones provided by
your ISP.

1) tell libttdnstor where to find the real nameserver(s)
 export TTDNSD_REALRESOLVCONF=/etc/resolv.conf.tor

2) run tor with libttdnstor to give tor access to real nameserver(s)
 LD_PRELOAD=FULL_PATH_TO_libttdnstor.so.1 ./tor

3) run ttdnsd
 echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" >/etc/resolv.conf
 torify ttdnsd -b 127.0.0.1 -f /etc/ttdnsd.conf
